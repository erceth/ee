            <p>Hello, my name is Eric Ethington. Welcome to my website. This site serves as a front page of ericethington.com. The purpose of ericethington.com is two parts. One, a place for me to show off my personal projects and two, to help people get to know me a little better. From now on every time I create a new personal project I will put a link here for people to refer to.</p>
            <p>I’m a web developer. I am graduated in Computer Science from Brigham Young University in April 2013. I have been working as a front end web developer ever since. While in college I had an internship for a year where I got my taste for web development and decided that’s that I wanted as a career.</p>
            <p>I also have a strong interest in Psychology. I graduated with a minor simply because I liked it. I read psychology type book often and I am fascinated with how people work.</p>
            <p>I have a smart and beautiful wife that I love very much. We are best friends. We love spending time with each other and sharing our big ideas with each other.</p>
            <p>I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Members of the church are often called Mormons because of their belief of additional scripture called <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/introduction?lang=eng" target="_blank">The Book of Mormon</a>. Some of the interesting practices that set us apart are no drinking alcohol, no drugs, no sex before marriage and very strong family values. A significant percentage of Mormons speak a different language. Many Mormons are very successful in business.</p>
            <p>That’s a little bit about me. I hope you find some interest in me an my projects.</p>
